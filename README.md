## Comparing my Spotify 2020 and 2023 Data

** Motivation **
* I want to see the alteration of my taste in music through 2020 to 2023 years. I had 5 hypothesis that motivated me to do this project:
* 1) Through 2020 to 2023 my music genre did not change and stayed same and stayed as Rock (Turkish).
  2) Through 2020 to 2023 the tempo (BPM) of the musics that I listened increased.
  3) Duman (Turkish rock group) was always in my top 5 artists.
  4) The average Energy of the songs that I listened through 2020 to 2023 was increased.
  5) Correlation values between BPM and Energy nwere need to be very strong for both 2020 and 2023 years.*
